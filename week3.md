## Week 3 â€“ Category Theory Fundamentals

### Plan

Based on the mentimeter results, we use next week's meeting to better understand the fundamentals of category theory. Here is a list of topics and some results we can prove to better understand the concepts. We present our proofs during the meeting and discuss them. Of course, we can discuss other topics as well. 

**Categories and Functors:**

I suggest we cover the following parts from [Tom Leinster's book: "Basic Category Theory" (arXiv link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375):

- 1.1 Categories: Page 10-16
    - Exercises: 1.1.13 and 1.1.14
- 1.2 Functors: Page 17-20 and Example 1.2.9
    - Exercises: 1.2.21 and 1.2.22

**Monomorphisms, Epimorphisms and Isomorphisms:**

- Prove that a morphism (function) in $\textbf{Set}$ is an epimorphism if and only if it is surjective. 
- Prove that if $f=g \circ h$ and $f$ is an isomorphism, then $g$ is an epimorphism and $h$ is a monomorphism. Moreover, if either $g$ or $h$ is an isomorphism, then the other is an isomorphism as well. 

**(Co)products:**

- Prove that [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)#Definition) are unique up to isomorphism.
- Prove that the disjoint union is the [coproduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct#Definition) in the category of sets.

**Other:**

- It was suggested that we have a cake for next week. I try to remember.
