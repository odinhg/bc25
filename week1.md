# Week 1 â€“ Why Category Theory?

Category theory encodes mathematical structures and relationships in a very general way. Requires (associative) compositionality.

Deep learning is a relatively young field with many ad-hoc constructions. Can we find a more systematic approach using category theory?

:bulb: **Goals for the course:**

- Understand the basics of category theory.
- Give (practical) examples from deep learning.
- Make sene of the underlying philosophy.


## :stew: Compositionality

**Their definition:**

1. Ability to build systems by composing them out of smaller parts.
2. Ability to reason about the resulting system by understanding the parts.

Compositionality is a proprety of our models of the systems, not the systems themselves.

## Plan for next week

Watch [Lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU7KyZn_hBc) up to 1:18:45 (up to and including the part about functors).
